Privacy Policy — Wordle Wizard (Unofficial)

Last updated: 2026-01-28

Summary
- This extension does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information to external servers.
- All data is processed locally in your browser.

Data usage
- The extension stores a small dictionary and a bundled meanings map in chrome.storage.local to provide quick definitions and suggestions. This data is bundled with the extension and may be persisted in local storage for offline use.
- No telemetry, analytics, or external network calls are made by default that would send user data off-device. The extension may fetch packaged resources (bundled JSON files) from its own package to initialize local storage.
- On-demand definition lookups: The extension may make optional, user-initiated requests to external services (e.g., Wiktionary) when the user asks to look up a definition. These requests are made only as a result of explicit user actions and are not sent automatically or without consent.

Support and contact
- For questions or to request data removal, open an issue on the repository or email: (provide your support email here)

Note about trademarks
- This project is an unofficial helper for Wordle-style games and is not affiliated with nor endorsed by their respective owners.
