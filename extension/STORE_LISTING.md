Chrome Web Store listing guidance (for `extension/`) 

Short description (recommended):
Unofficial helper for Wordle-style games — suggests optimal next guesses and shows short definitions.

Full description (example):
Wordle Wizard (Unofficial) helps you make better guesses in Wordle-style puzzles. It detects your attempts in-game, tracks feedback, and suggests the next optimal guess using deterministic solver logic. No account or network tracking is required — the solver and word lists run locally. Includes an optional meanings database for short definitions of suggested words.

Privacy summary (short):
No personal data is collected. The extension stores bundled resources locally and does not send gameplay or user data to external servers.

Screenshots
- Add 3–6 PNGs showing: panel open, top suggestion, meaning tooltip, and a sample win state.
- Put screenshots in `extension/screenshots/` and name them `screenshot1.png`, `screenshot2.png`, ...

Support
- Provide a contact email for the store listing. Also link to the GitHub repo in the homepage URL.

Notes
- Consider adding the word “(Unofficial)” to the title to reduce trademark issues. Keep requested permissions minimal and document why each host permission is needed in PUBLISHING.md.
